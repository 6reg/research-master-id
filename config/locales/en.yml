# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

          label: "Step 1:"
          text: "Search for existing Research Master records. It is strongly recommended that multiple search methods are used. If a RMID is found, use the available fields to verify that this is the same study and then document the RMID# for future reference; If no RMID is found, continue to Step 2."
        step2:
          label: "Step 2:"
          text: "When you are certain the study does not have an existing RMID number, click on the “Create a Research Master ID” button at the bottom of the page to create a new record. Upon successful creation, please retain the RMID for use in other systems."
